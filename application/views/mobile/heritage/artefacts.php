				<p>The majority of images of 1848 theatre of the Royal Polytechnic Institution are line drawings, and so give us little clue to the decoration. However two watercolours of 1882 show a richly decorated room with green walls and features picked out in red and gold. Black and white photographs of the auditorium around the turn-of-the-century appear to show that all these colours have gone in the 1894 refurbishment. Certainly by the 1926 re-build the original Victorian plasterwork has been replaced with a white neo-classical Art Deco style and moldings highlighted in gold. Surprisingly few images exist of the auditorium until 1980, when a black & white photograph shows a darker colour on the wall. The decorative scheme reverted to white in the 1995 refurbishment, and today the colours reflect the heritage of the space.</p>

				<p>The magic lantern slides used at the Royal Polytechnic Institution were larger than usual slides, at around 20cm x 15cm. The image was projected onto a circular oil canvas screen with a diameter of almost 9m, at a distance of 11m from the back of the theatre. This was achieved through the use of oxyhydrogen – or limelight as it was commonly known.  The special large format slides enabled a clear and detailed image to be seen on the screen, even at this size and distance.</p>

					<p>The 1848 theatre of the Royal Polytechnic Institution was purpose-built for magic lantern shows and held 1500 people, with shows often running twice a day. However the sales particular of 1881 described it as holding ‘between 800 and 900 persons’. Quintin Hogg bought the building and converted it into a meeting hall, seating 1100 people, with an additional 150 on the platform. The seating numbers after the 1894 refurbishment – and therefore at the time of the Lumiere’s Cinematographe screening – aren’t confirmed but are believed to be roughly the same. We do know however that the audience were seated on loose wooden chairs, rather than the fixed plush seats of today.</p>
				<?php } ?>
				<p>As audiences came to expect comfort as much as spectacle, the number of seats in the cinema reduced. After the 1926 rebuilding, the cinema only seated 610. By comparison, the 1928 Empire Theatre in Leicester Square seated 3300. Further seats seem to have been removed with each successive refurbishment and by the time it closed as the Regent Theatre in 1979, the auditorium seated only 517.</p>

				<p>A proscenium arch is the frame around a theatre stage. The victorian Royal Polytechnic Institution theatre had a decorative and richly coloured proscenium arch, but this was removed in 1894, when the auditorium was converted into a meeting hall. However a new one was installed during the 1926 renovations, introducing the art deco styling that can still be seen today.</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>The original 1848 projection or ‘manipulating room’ was at the back of the auditorium, between the two levels of seating. This was used for projecting Magic Lantern slides onto a large circular screen on the stage. The projecting room was removed during the 1894 refurbishment. When the Lumiere’s Cinematographe was exhibited in 1896, it was projected from the floor of the auditorium onto a temporary screen. The projection room above the balcony was installed during the 1926 rebuild. In order to achieve clear sight lines, part of the original iron girders in the ceiling had to be removed.</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>The pipes for the cinema organ are inside a wooden chamber at the back of the stage and this is where the sound is produced. When a key is pressed on the console, an electrical current carries the information to the pipes. This controls the flow of air through the pipes, and produces sound. The vibrato effect is created by manually shaking the air source. The sound produced by the organ is not amplified at all by electricity. Instead the volume is controlled by the flaps at the front of the chamber. As well as the pipes, there are real instruments inside the chamber such as a glockenspiel and sleigh bells.</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>In 1894 a gallery was installed around the auditorium. This replaced the original tiered seating of the 1848 theatre and turned it more into a meeting hall for lectures, debates, teaching and even boxing. By 1926 the majority of the gallery was removed, in favour of the balcony we see today. However, for reasons that are not clear, the portion behind the stage was left, giving us a glimpse into the past.</p>

				<p>The floor level of the 1848 theatre was lower, with the seating descending from the entrance to the stage. Underneath the stage was a pit that was used to create the ‘Pepper’s Ghost’ illusion. The floor was levelled when Quintin Hogg purchased the building, and then raised further during the 1894 re-build, reducing the height of the auditorium from 50ft to 30ft.</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>When the cinema opened as a magic lantern theatre in 1848, it would have had no electric light. The primary means of lighting the theatre was from a skylight. This was covered by movable shutters during daytime performances and which enabled the theatre ‘in an instant to restore the light again for the general promenade of the public’. The skylight was covered during the 1926 re-build as additional classrooms were added overhead. An electric light was therefore installed in the ceiling instead.</p>

				<p>The original balcony was removed in 1894 when Hogg re-developed the theatre into a more general ‘hall’, with gallery seating now running round all 4 sides of the room. This was, in turn, removed in 1926 to be replaced with a balcony in the art deco style.</p>
