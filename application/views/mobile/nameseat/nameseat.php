		<h2>It’s more than just a seat</h2>
		<p>Support the Regent Street Cinema in its journey to transform back into a landmark venue for film and the future of film education.</p>
		<p>To raise money to restore the Cinema we are offering supporters the chance to name a seat and join 200 others in raising £200,000 towards securing the future of the Cinema.</p>
		<p>Naming a seat in the Regent Street Cinema is an ideal gift for a friend or loved one. It is also a thoughtful way to remember someone who had a passion for cinema or the University of Westminster in their lifetime.</p>
